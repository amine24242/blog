Today I'm starting this blog. A place to write about what I'm building, what I'm thinking about, and what's happening day to day.

## Why write

I've been building for a while now but never documented the process. The wins, the dead ends, the random ideas at 2am that actually turn into something. This is where all of that goes.

## What I'm working on

Right now it's **besti** — an AI that actually does things for you instead of just talking about doing things. The gap between "AI can help you" and "AI just did it for you" is enormous, and that's exactly where we're building.

> The best way to predict the future is to build it.

More tomorrow.
